When Fusazaki's retinue arrives at Shido-no-ura Bay they meet a certain woman diver. After exchanging words Fusazaki's retainer asks her to dive in the ocean and cut seaweed. Being reminded by the request the diver tells them of an event that occurred in the bay.
"The Jewel of Menko-fuhai-no-tama" which was offered when a sister of Lord Tankai became the empress of the T'ang Dynasty was stolen by Ryūgū (the Dragon King's Palace). Lord Tankai traveled incognito and stayed in this bay to get the jewel back.
A diver in this bay eventually had a baby with His Excellency.
In order to make her son the heir to Lord Tankai she sacrificed her life to go to the Dragon King's Palace and brought the jewel back.
Through the narrative the diver imitates the scene in which the jewel was brought back from the undersea palace.
